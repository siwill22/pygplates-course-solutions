    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook goes through the steps of\n",
    "- accessing geoscientific data directly from web servers and loading into python\n",
    "- converting these data into a GPlates-compatible version\n",
    "- carrying out spatial analysis that compares fossil occurences to the locations of interpreted paleoshorelines through geological time\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of this exercise goes through the actions of getting data sets directly from web services, and loading them into your python workspace. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by doing something that has nothing to do with GPlates whatsoever. We use a python module called 'requests' to make a request to a web service run by the USGS, and load the data into a pandas dataframe (the function 'StringIO' is also used to help pandas recognise the data stream that comes back from the USGS web service as something resembling a csv file).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when you run the next cell, you will have to wait for a while as the data is downloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "To quickly see what is in returned data, we can print the resulting text, which reveals a stream of data in csv format.\n"
